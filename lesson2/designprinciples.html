            <p>Hubspot makes good use of the rule of thirds on the main page. On the first third
                you can see that it says "Start free or get a demo". On the last third (farthest to the right) you can 
                see that there were some graphics included. This sort of layout is very pleasing to the eye and brings 
                attention to the button since our eyes start from left to right. Overall, this webpage has a good balance
                and uses the rule of thirds well.

            <p>This website makes very good use of white spaces. You can see here that 
                each of the photos of the people are well spread out and they have an equal
                amount of white space around each photo.

                <p>This website does a great job at using visual hierachy. As you can see, it is 
            very pleasing to the eye and main parts of text that your eye is drawn to form a 
            "Z" shape. This is called the Z-pattern.
