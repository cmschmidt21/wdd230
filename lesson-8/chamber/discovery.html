            <p>Paradise Island is an Island in the Bahamas previously known
                as hog island. It is located just off the shore of Nassau which 
                is located on the northern edge of the island of New Providence.
                Paradise Island is connected to New Providence by two bridges 
                across the Naussau Harbor. Paradise Island was purchased in the 
                1980s for $79 million, then sold to Merv Griffin for $400 million. 
                It was last sold for $125 million to the current owner, Sol Kerzner.

          <br>
          <p>Paradise Island's culture is truly one of a kind! Musical traditions here reflect 
            both the impact of history on the islands and a homegrown, distinctively national 
            character. All through the islands of The Bahamas, music is woven deeply into the 
            fabric of daily life‚Äîso much so that one of the nicknames given to our archipelago 
            is ‚Äúthe Islands of Song‚Äù. Blues and spirituals made their way down from the American 
            South and took on a Bahamian flavor, in breezy seaside church choirs where rhyming 
            spirituals are sung, and on homemade guitars in the hands of virtuoso performers like 
            the legendary Joseph Spence and his contemporary Israel Forbes.Once You
            visit and experiene all that the Island has to offer, you will surely
            never want to leave! Come enjoy the bright colors, try fantastic 
            island cuisine, and experience one of a kind island experiences.
